			<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
			<p id="about">
				I am a recent graduate from University of the Arts London
				where I studied BA Advertising, and am currently 21 years old. <br><br>
				I have a lot of different hobbies, some more well known than
				others. My hobbies include dance, drama, photography, and curling.
				I also played in my University netball and Cheerleading teams,
				and am also a qualified Zumba instructor. Music is also a passion
				of mine with playing the flute and drums.
